A test script to show a few simple tests for the sequential list ADT.
This is an example of a start to a test plan.  These tests are very incomplete.

Assumptions: these tests are designed with a list size of 4.  

TEST 1:  Add three entries to list.  

insert 0
111
10
20
11
21
1
4
1
100
1
insert 1
222
12
22
12
22
1
4
1
100
2
pushback
333
13
23
13
23
1
4
1
100
3

To determine if test 1 passes look for two Inserted messages and a Pushed

quit

TEST 2: Print the list and verify three entries are sorted 

print
stats

To deterine if test 2 passes list should be printed in order with 3 records.
Also, stats should show 3 records with an array size of 4

TEST 3:  Update the 111 entry in the list

replace 0
111
14
24
14
24
1
4
1
100
4

To determine if test 3 passes look for "Updated" message

TEST 4: Print the list, verify entry for 111 replaced

print
stats

To determine if test 4 passes look for 3 records, and 111 record should be 
updated with Time as 4.  Stats should still be 3 records, size 4

TEST 5: look for records in the list 

at 1
front
back

To determine if test 5 passes should print record 222 then 111 and then 333

TEST 6:  Attempt to add fourth record into first position. 

insert 0
444
15
25
15
25
1
4
1
100
5
print
stats

To check test 6, verify that records are 444, 111, 222, and 333.
The stats should should 4 records and an array size of 4


TEST 7: Remove the last element in the list then the first
popback 
print

erase 0
print

To verify test 7, should first see list with 444, 111, 222.  After the
erase should see 111, 222.

TEST 8: Quit

quit

to verify test 8, run with valgrind and confirm there are no memory leaks
    valgrind --leak-check=full ./lab1 < testinput

//UNIT DRIVER 0: Tests on an empty table

Open addressing with linear probe sequence
Seed: 1479774267

----- Unit Driver 0 -----
The table is empty.
----- Passed Driver -----


Table size (11), load factor (0.9)
Open addressing with double hashing
Seed: 1479774267

----- Unit Driver 0 -----

----- Passed Driver -----


THEORETICAL RESULTS: This driver uses various functions from table.c to test
		     an empty table. It has many assertions to test if they 
		     if they are working correctly. All probe types should 
		     run the driver, printing that the table is empty and 
		     then display if it passed.

ACTUAL RESULTS: Passed the test for each probe type.

THEORETICAL RESULTS: The test should insert regulary, duplicates (depending on
		     the seed) and into a full table (if open addressing). If
		     verbose is on, it should print the key being inserting 
		     along with it's hash index and probe decrement value. It 
		     should also print the table after each insertion/deletion.
		     Each probe type should complete, displaying that the table 
		     is empty at the end and there are no memory leaks. 

ACTUAL RESULTS: Passed the test for all probe types










// UNIT DRIVER 2: Test on double hashing with catastrophic table size

Table size (11), load factor (0.9)
Open addressing with linear probe sequence
Seed: 1479774267

----- Retrieve driver -----
  Trials: 50000
  Build table with 5 random keys
build of random table failed code (-1) index (4) key (mbmurdo)



THEORETICAL RESULTS: This test uses a small even number as the table size and shows 
                     that combining double hashing with a non prime table size will
                     result in not being able to insert the keys into the table. This
		     is because it visits the same indexes each time, never reaching a
		     an index that is NULL, even though the table is not full. It should
                     exit with "build of random table failed code (-1) index () key ()" */

ACTUAL RESULTS: Passed the test with a table size of 6
